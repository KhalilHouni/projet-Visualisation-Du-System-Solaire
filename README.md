# Interactive Solar System and Space Data Visualization

Welcome to the Interactive Solar System and Space Data Visualization project! This interactive application allows users to explore the solar system, visualize planets in 3D, access information about planets, listen to their sounds, track near-Earth asteroids, view NASA's picture of the day, locate the International Space Station (ISS) in real-time, and interact with a chatbot named Space Clippy for additional information and entertainment.
This project was made in 2 weeks.

## Features

- **Interactive Solar System Visualization**: Explore the solar system and interact with planets.
- **3D Planet Models**: Click on planets to view their 3D models and obtain information about them.
- **Planet Sounds**: Listen to sounds produced by planets.
- **Near-Earth Asteroids**: View a chart or table of near-Earth asteroids passing by.
- **NASA Picture of the Day**: Access NASA's daily picture.
- **ISS Location**: Track the real-time location of the International Space Station on a world map.
- **Space Clippy Chatbot**: Interact with Space Clippy to obtain information about planets, their moons, jokes, weather updates, or perform YouTube searches. Space Clippy can also suggest questions if you're unsure.
